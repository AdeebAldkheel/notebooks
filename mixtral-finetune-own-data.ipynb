    "In this notebook and tutorial, we will fine-tune the [Mixtral 8x7B](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-v0.1) Mixture of Experts (MoE) model, which outperforms Llama 2 70B on most tested benchmarks.\n",

    "In this notebook, we will load the large model in 4bit using `bitsandbytes` and use LoRA to train using the PEFT library from Hugging Face 🤗.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that if you ever have trouble importing something from Huggingface, you may need to run `huggingface-cli login` in a shell. To open a shell in Jupyter Lab, click on 'Launcher' (or the '+' if it's not there) next to the notebook tab at the top of the screen. Under \"Other\", click \"Terminal\" and then run the command.\n",

    "To re-try after you tweak your parameters, open a Terminal ('Launcher' or '+' in the nav bar above -> Other -> Terminal) and run the command `nvidia-smi`. Then find the process ID `PID` under `Processes` and run the command `kill [PID]`. You will need to re-start your notebook from the beginning.

    "I used Exporter, a free local-only app, to export my Apple Notes to `.txt` files, and then I wrote a script to process each note into one `.jsonl` file. Note that for this script, ChatGPT can help out a LOT if you tell it how your data is currently formatted, how you'd like it to be formatted, and ask it to write a script in a certain language you know well (for any debugging) to do so. I also broke up my journal entries so the training sample vector length was smaller (see the discussion on `max_length` and the data visualization below). I broke it into pieces so that contexts were encapsulated entirely, since I did want the model to understand context about my life. My data were ultimately formatted as:\n",
